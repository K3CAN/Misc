# rpcoutlets has moved

rpcoutlets is a script I wrote to simplify the process of controlling a Baytech RPC-2 remote power distribution unit.

It's now located [here](https://github.com/K3CAN/Baytech-RPC2)



_NB. I'm a total noob when it comes to Github. I started by just dumping everything into a single repository and now realize that it might make more sense to seperate different projects into their own repos._
