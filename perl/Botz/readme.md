#Bots

  This is a game I recovered from an old hard drive. I suspect I was in my early teenage years when I wrote it. While it still looks _functional_, it's likely NOT a demonstration of perl's best practices nor effecint code writing. I'm just including it here as a fun part of my personal history.
